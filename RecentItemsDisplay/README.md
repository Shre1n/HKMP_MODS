# HollowKnight.RecentItemsDisplay

Plugin for ItemChanger to show recent items in the top right of the screen. Requires ItemChanger to be installed.

Contains a toggle (in the mod menu) to show/hide the display. The number of items displayed can be set in the mod menu (default 5).

By default, refreshed items (such as soul refills and lifeblood when it's not the first time collecting them) will not be sent to the display; this behaviour can be toggled in the mod menu.

With DebugMod installed, the display can be moved using the binds on the Recent Items Config page in the keybinds panel.
