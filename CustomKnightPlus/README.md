# [Custom Knight Plus](https://github.com/HKLab/CustomKnightPlus)

A mod providing conditional skin support for [Custom Knight](https://github.com/PrashantMohta/HollowKnight.CustomKnight).

Do NOT use together with [Asymmetric Knight](https://github.com/PrashantMohta/HollowKnight.CustomKnight/tree/master/AddonExample/AsymmetricKnight) as some features conflicts with each other.

## Usage

> All suffixes mentioned below are case-insensitive.

### Asymmetric

Attach `_left` after normal skin file name to make asymmetric skin, for example, put `Knight.png` and `Knight_left.png` into the skin folder, then the former will get applied when the knight is facing right, and the latter will get applied when facing left.

## Map zone specific

Attach map zone name after normal skin file name to make map zone specific skin, for example, put `Unn.png` and `Unn_green_path.png` into the skin folder, then the former will get applied when the knight is not in Greenpath, and the latter will get applied when in Greenpath.
